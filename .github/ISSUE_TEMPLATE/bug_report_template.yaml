        - **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:
        - **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:
        - **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:

      label: Tracking information
      description: |
        For bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:
        ```python
        print("MLflow version:", mlflow.__version__)
        print("Tracking URI:", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())
        print("Artifact URI:", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())
        ```
        Then, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below. If you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it.
